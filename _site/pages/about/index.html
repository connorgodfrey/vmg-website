&lt;p&gt;Connor T. Godfrey is the founder of VMG Business Advisory PLLC, a law practice focused on providing pragmatic corporate counsel to entrepreneurs, investors, funds, and emerging companies. Drawing on years of experience across both the legal and financial sectors, Connor offers business-oriented legal guidance designed to advance clients&#39; strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connor holds a J.D. from the &lt;strong&gt;University at Buffalo School of Law&lt;/strong&gt;, where he graduated with honors and developed his expertise in corporate law, mergers and acquisitions, and private capital markets. He also holds a B.S. in Finance from the &lt;strong&gt;Gabelli School of Business at Fordham University&lt;/strong&gt;, providing a strong financial foundation that informs his transactional practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to founding VMG Business Advisory PLLC, Connor accumulated experience across multiple facets of the legal profession — including time at a mid-sized corporate law firm, boutique legal practice, and as in-house counsel for a technology company. In addition, his early career included experience as a financial analyst at a major banking institution, giving him valuable insight into the financial drivers that underlie complex corporate transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connor is admitted to practice law in the State of New York and combines legal precision with business fluency to support clients in venture capital financings, fund formation, M&amp;A transactions, corporate governance, securities compliance, and other corporate matters.&lt;/p&gt;
