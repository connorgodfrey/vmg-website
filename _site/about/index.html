<h2>About the Name: VMG</h2>

<p>“VMG” — Velocity Made Good — is a term drawn from sailboat racing, where it denotes speed made toward the ultimate goal, not simply maximum raw speed. In racing, a boat might travel slower through the water but more directly toward the mark, making better progress than a faster boat heading off-course.</p>

<p>This reflects the philosophy of VMG Business Advisory: legal counsel focused on efficiently advancing a client’s true objectives rather than maximizing activity or complexity.
